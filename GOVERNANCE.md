# Governance

## Authority and The Core Team

### Governance
**Anchorage Digital** retains all rights, title, and interest in the repository. Final decision-making authority rests with the Anchorage Digital internal engineering leadership.

### The Core Team
The "Core Team" is the only group authorized to merge code, approve pull requests, and manage releases. This team is composed of:

1. **Anchorage Digital Employees:** Internal engineering staff.
2. **Authorized Partners:** designated representatives from partner organizations (e.g., Turnkey).
3. **Contractors:** Engineering contractors vetted and authorized by Anchorage Digital.

### Contribution Workflow
* **Core Team Members:** May review and approve PRs. We currently require at least one Anchorage employee to review and Approve PRs.
* **Community/Public:** May submit PRs, but they must be approved by a Core Team member. We currently require at least one Anchorage employee to review and Approve PRs. For protocol owners in chains/dapps that we consider in maintenance mode, we want to require 1 Anchorage Employee and 1 Protocol Owner to approve the PR.
* Note: Being a Partner or Contractor does not grant automatic administrative rights over the repository settings, only code maintenance rights.
